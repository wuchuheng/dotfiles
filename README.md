# ZPM Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository for Zsh, managed with the Zsh Plugin Manager (ZPM). This setup is designed to streamline my shell environment with custom configurations, functions, and themes for Zsh.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have `zsh` installed on your system. ZPM will be used to manage Zsh plugins and themes.

## Installation

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zpm-shell/zpm-dotfiles-template/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Features

- **Plugin Management:** Easily add, update, and manage Zsh plugins.
- **Themes:** Customize your terminal's appearance with ZPM-managed themes.
- **Aliases and Functions:** Define your own shortcuts and functions for common tasks.
- **Prompt Customization:** Adjust your prompt with ZPM plugins and themes to display the information you need.

## Customizing

To customize your Zsh environment:

- Edit `zpm.zsh` to add or remove plugins and themes.
- Modify `aliases.zsh` and `functions.zsh` to tweak your aliases and shell functions.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and customize your own Zsh environment. If you have suggestions or improvements, pull requests are welcome.
